# Skins2Bucks

Have you ever wondered how much your account would be worth if you were to sell it ? This script is made for you !
The script uses [Riot LCU API](https://lcu.vivide.re/) to retrieve all the skins you own, then finds their price tiers using [CommunityDragon JSON data](https://raw.communitydragon.org/latest/plugins/rcp-be-lol-game-data/global/default/v1/skins.json) (up to date until 06/17/2024). 

## How to use
Open a command prompt at the project's root directory then execute the PowerShell script by typing ```.\getAccountValue.ps1``` (League client has to be launched).
*N.B : You must have Python installed before running the script or your computer might explode ⚠️*
